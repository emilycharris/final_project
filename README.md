## Final Project for The Iron Yard

This was my final capstone project for The Iron Yard. 


The requirements of the project were as follows:
- Include a web application written in Python/Django.
- Use data stored in a database.
- Integrate with at least one "outside" data store or API.
- Provide an API to at minimum query data.
- Be useful in some way, not just a direct clone of something that already exists. Add value or a niche to an existing application.
- Use at least one technology or package we haven't covered in class.
- Integrate a form of image upload and storage.
- Be deployed on the public Internet, with a service like Heroku.

With these requirements in mind, I chose to build [FamilyTV.online](http://www.familytv.online).  FamilyTV.online is a fully functioning web application that provides a means for families to watch TV together, all the while ensuring that the programming is both fairly selected and age-appropriate for all viewers.

The application was created using the Python programming language, as well as the Django web framework. Front-end development includes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. There are also API endpoints using Django's REST framework.  The application was successfully deployed to the web using Heroku and AWS S3.
